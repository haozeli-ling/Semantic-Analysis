# Dimensions of meaning 

The algorithm we aim to develop is designed to compute the meaning of natural language, but we encounter a challenge ... 

- The "information conveyed" by a sentence is far from straightforward.
- It appears to encompass at least three distinct subcategories

  - Assertion
  - Presupposition
  - Implicature

Consider the following conversation: 

> A: How did Daveâ€™s physical go? <br>
> B: Well, he stoppped smoking.

B's utterance express the following information: 

- Assertion: Dave has stoped smoking. 
- Presupposition: Dave used to smoke.
- Implicature: Dave may have received bad news at his physical.
