# Dimensions of meaning 

The algorithm we aim to develop is designed to compute the meaning of natural language, but we encounter a challenge ... 

- The "information conveyed" by a sentence is far from straightforward.
- It appears to encompass at least three distinct subcategories
  - Assertion
  - Presupposition
  - Implicature

Consider the following conversation: 

> A: How did Dave’s physical go? <br>
> B: Well, he stoppped smoking.

B's utterance express the following information: 

- Assertion: Dave has stoped smoking. 
- Presupposition: Dave used to smoke.
- Implicature: Dave may have received bad news at his physical.

Assertion = the information that the utterance explicitly added = Truth condition

- The sentence uttered by B is true if and only if Dave has stopped smoking. 

Presupposition = the information that is taken for granted prior to uttering a sentence

- The sentence uttered by B presupposes that Dave used to smoke.
- A can only evaluate the truth of the sentence only if A knows that Dave used to smoke.
- What happens if this presupposition is unknown to A?
  > A: How did Dave’s physical go? <br>
  > B: Well, he stoppped smoking. <br>
  > A: Wait a minute. Did Dave smoke before?
