# Dimensions of meaning 

The algorithm we aim to develop is designed to compute the meaning of natural language, but we encounter a challenge ... 

- The "information conveyed" by a sentence is far from straightforward.
- It appears to encompass at least three distinct subcategories
  - Assertion
  - Presupposition
  - Implicature

Consider the following conversation: 

1. A: How did Dave’s physical go? <br>
   B: Well, he stoppped smoking.

B's utterance express the following information: 

- Assertion: Dave has stoped smoking. 
- Presupposition: Dave used to smoke.
- Implicature: Dave may have received bad news at his physical.

#### Assertion = the information that the utterance explicitly added = Truth condition

The sentence uttered by B is true if and only if Dave has stopped smoking. 

#### Presupposition = the information that is taken for granted prior to uttering a sentence

The sentence uttered by B presupposes that Dave used to smoke. Speaker A can only evaluate the truth of the sentence only if A knows that Dave used to smoke. What happens if this presupposition is unknown to A?
  
2. A: How did Dave’s physical go? <br>
   B: Well, he stoppped smoking. <br>
   A: Wait a minute. Did Dave smoke before?
  
Presuppositions are immune to negation.

3. Dave didn't stop smoking. <br>
   $\Rightarrow$ Dave is still smoking. <br>
   Presuppose: Dave used to smoke. 

#### Implicature = The information that is not explicitly stated in the utterance but is clearly intended by the speaker for the listener to infer 

Impicature is cancelable and depends on contexts. 

4. A: How did Dave’s physical go? <br>
   B: Well, he stoppped smoking, but he did fine one his physical. 

## Consequence for our developing the algorithm

It must be able to compute all three kinds of meaning: assertion, presupposition, and implicature. However, we have to start from somewhere. 

So, let's choose the explicitly stated informtion as our starting point--assertion, i.e,. truth conditions.

Exercise: Consider the following sentences.

a. Jimmy Carter won only four states.
b. Donald Trump will add tariffs even on Canada. 

Please list the assertion and presupposition for each sentence.
