# 06. Computing extensions

Now, we are in a position to initiate our building of an algorithm to compute meaning. 

> Intuition: <br>
> Semantic Value of 'Annie' + Semantic Value of 'danced' = Semantic Value of 'Annie danced' <br>
> Given a model $M$, $⟦\text{Annie}⟧^M$ + $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M$ = $⟦\text{Annie danced}⟧^M$ = the truth value of 'Annie danced' in $M$.

What we have known is:
- $⟦\text{Annie}⟧^M$ = "a"
- $⟦\text{Annie danced}⟧^M$ = 1, iff "a" $\in$ { $x$ : $x$ danced } $\subseteq$ $A$ 

In mathematics, a set can be presented either by listing its members or by using set-builder notation to specify a defining condition (a common feature shared by all members in this set). For example, suppose that Annie, Bob, and Cindy are dancers in our model, then the set of all dancers can be presented as follows: 

```
(a) {"a", "b", "c"}
(b) {x : x danced}
```

Our task is to resolve the following equation:
- "a" $+ ⟦\text{danced}⟧^M = 1$


## Extension of predicates = characteristic functions 

Based on the equation, the extension of the predicate *danced* must be able to combine with the object $\text{s}$ to yield the truth value. 

Functions provide a powerful tool for modeling combination. 

- In mathematics, a **function** is a precisely defined rule that maps elements from one set, called the **domain**, to elements of another set, called the **codomain**, such that **each input is associated with exactly one output**. Functions allow us to model systematic dependencies: once the input is fixed, the output is fully determined.
- This idea is central across mathematics because it captures how complex objects can be built from simpler ones in a compositional and predictable way. Rather than being viewed as formulas or computations alone, functions are abstract objects that encode stable input–output relations.
- This perspective is especially powerful in formal semantics, where meanings of linguistic expressions are treated as functions from individuals or situations to truth values or other semantic objects, making the computation of sentence meaning explicit and formally tractable.

Given a set such as { $x$ : $x$ danced }, we can define a **characteristic function** $f$: 

- $f(x) = 1$ iff $x \in$ { $x$ : $x$ danced }
- $f$ is a **function mapping objects to truth values**, i.e., a characteristic function. 
- Suppose in $M$, { $x$ : $x$ danced } = {"a", "b", "c"}, $f$("a") = 1 , but $f$ ("d") = 0


> [!NOTE] 
> [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege)'s Conjecture: Meanings combine via fucntion application.

To combine two meanings, one must function as a **function** and the other as its **argument**. The resulting combined meaning is the output of applying the function to the argument.

Ideally, function application should serve as the **sole** combinatorial rule in our algorithm.

## Lambda notation

In formal semantics, it is standard practice to use lambda notation to write a function: 

-  $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M$ = $\lambda x \in A: 1$ iff $x \in$ { $x$ : $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$ ($A$ is the set of objects in $M$)
-  In prose: the extension of the word *danced* is a function maps any object in $A$ to 1 iff this object is a member of the set of people who danced in $M$.

To facilitate typing in Word, we use the following symbols as replacements for mathematical symbols. 

```
F('danced') = lambda x in A: 1 iff x in {x: x danced} <= A
```
| **Math Symbol**                  | **Our Symbol** | **Meaning** |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| $\lambda$ | lambda | lambda notation | 
| $\in$ | in | set membership |
| $\subseteq$ | <= | subset relation | 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Re-write the function [ $\lambda x \in A. 1$ iff $x \in$ { $x$ : $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$ ] as follows <br>
> ```
> danced_f 
> ```
> Apply this function to a variable $x$: <br>
> ```
> danced_f(x) = 1 iff x in {x : x danced} <= A
> ```
> Using the $\lambda$ operator to bind $x$ return the same function:
> ```
> lambda x in A: danced_f(x) = lambda x in A: 1 iff x in {x: x danced} <= A
> ```
> Since $A$ is always drawn from the model $M$, we may simply omit it: <br>
> ```
> lambda x: danced_f(x)
> ```


Then, the extensional meaning of 'Sue danced' can be computed as follows:

```
F('Annie danced') = F('danced')(F('Annie'))
                  = [lambda x: danced_f(x)]("a")
                  = danced_f("a")
                  = 1 iff "a" in {x: x danced} <= A
```

> #### Exercise
> Assuming a a model $M$ such that $⟦\text{John}⟧^M = \text{j}$ where $\text{j}$ is an individual who didn't leave in $M$. Please define the meaning for 'left' and compute the meaning of the sentence 'John left'.
