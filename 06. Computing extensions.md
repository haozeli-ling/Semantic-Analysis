# Computing extensions

Now, we are in a position to initiate our building of an algorithm to compute meaning. 

> Intuition: <br>
> Semantic Value of 'Sue' + Semantic Value of 'danced' = Semantic Value of 'Sue danced' <br>
> Given a model $M$, $⟦\text{Sue}⟧^M$ + $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M$ = $⟦\text{Sue danced}⟧^M$ = the truth value of 'Sue danced' in $M$.

What we have known is:
- $⟦\text{Sue}⟧^M$ = $\text{s}$
- $⟦\text{Sue danced}⟧^M$ = 1, iff $\text{s} \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq$ $A$ 

In mathematics, a set can be presented either by listing its members or by using set-builder notation. For example, suppose that Annie, Bob, and Cindy are dancers in our model, then the set of all dancers can be presented as follows: 

```
{"a", "b", "c"}
{ x : x is a dancer}
```

Our task is to resolve the following equation:
- $\text{s} + ⟦\text{danced}⟧^M = 1$





## Extension of predicates = characteristic functions 

Based on the equation, the extension of the predicate *danced* must be able to combine with the object $\text{s}$ to yield the truth value. 

Mathematically, given a set such as { $x$ | $x$ danced }, we can define a **characteristic function** $f$: 

- $f(x) = x \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced }
- $f$ is a **function mapping objects to truth values**, i.e., a characteristic function. 
- Suppose in $M$, { $x$ | $x$ danced } = {Sue, Mary, Peter}, $f(\text{s}) = 1$, but $f(\text{a}) = 0$

> [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege)'s Conjecture: Meanings combine via fucntion application.

To combine two meanings, one must function as a **function** and the other as its **argument**. The resulting combined meaning is the output of applying the function to the argument.

Ideally, function application should serve as the **sole** combinatorial rule in our algorithm.

## Lambda notation

In formal semantics, it is standard practice to use lambda notation to write a function: 

-  $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M$ = $\lambda x \in A. 1$ iff $x \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$ ($A$ is the set of objects in $M$)
-  In prose: the extension of the word *danced* is a function maps any object in $A$ to 1 iff this object is a member of the set of people who danced in $M$.

> Simpifying this definition <br>
> 1. Let's re-write the function [ $\lambda x \in A. 1$ iff $x \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$ ] as $\text{danced}'$ 
> 2. Apply this function to a variable $x$: 
>    - [ $\text{danced}'(x)$ ] = [ 1 iff $x \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$ ] <br>
>    - Using the $\lambda$ operator to bind $x$ return the same function:
>      - [ $\lambda x \in A.\text{danced}'(x)$ ] = [ $\lambda x \in A.1$ iff $x \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$ ]
> 3. Since $A$ is always drawn from the model $M$, we may simply omit it:
>    - $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M$ = $\lambda x.\text{danced}'(x)$

Then, the extensional meaning of 'Sue danced' can be computed as follows:

- $⟦\text{Sue danced}⟧^M$ <br>
  = $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M(⟦\text{Sue}⟧^M)$ <br>
  = [ $\lambda x.\text{danced}'(x)$ ] ($\text{s}$) <br>
  = $\text{danced}'(\text{s})$ <br>
  = 1 iff $\text{s} \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq A$


> #### Exercise
> Assuming a a model $M$ such that $⟦\text{John}⟧^M = \text{j}$ where $\text{j}$ is an individual who didn't leave in $M$. Please define the meaning for 'left' and compute the meaning of the sentence 'John left'.
