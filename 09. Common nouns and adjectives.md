# 09. Common nouns and adjectives (Discussion)

This session is devoted to the extensional meanings of common nouns and adjectives. Let's use Typed Lambda Calculus to work out their denotations together.

### Predicative uses

Common nouns and adjectives can be used to form predicates, expressing properties attributed to individuals.   

1. Obama is a politician.
2. Obama is male.

Step 1: What are the structures of these two sentences?

Step 2: What is the denotation of each word in these sentences? 

What we know: 

|  Denotation  | Type    |
|----------|----------|
| $⟦\text{Obama}⟧^M = \text{o}$ | $e$ | 
 

What we need to determine:  

|  Denotation  | Type    |
|----------|----------|
| $⟦\text{politician}⟧^M = $ |  |
| $⟦\text{male}⟧^M = $ |  |
| $⟦\text{is}⟧^M = $ |   |
| $⟦\text{a}⟧^M = $   |    |

In order to determine the denotations of the copula and the article "a", we should take the following facts into account:

- In some elementary schools in the US, the copula "is" is referred to as a "helping verb." It carries no inherent meaning but simply "helps" adjectives and nouns function as predicates.
- Compare the following Mandarin sentences with their English counterparts. What elements are missing in the Mandarin examples?   

3. 奥巴马 是 政客。<br>
   Obama is politician [gloss] <br>
   Obama is a politician [English counterpart]
   
4. 奥巴马 高，   姚明      更   高。 <br>
   Obama tall  Yao Ming more tall [gloss] <br>
   Obama is tall. Yao Ming is taller. [English counterpart]

### Sets and characteristic functions

In [Session 5](https://github.com/haozeli-ling/Semantic-Analysis/blob/main/05.%20Model.md), common nouns are modeled as sets of individuals. However, to achieve compositionality, common nouns must instead be treated as functions. What, then, is the relationship between sets of individuals and functions? 

```
F('student') = {"a", "b", "c"}
```
```
F('student') = lambda x : student_f(x) 
Type: e -> t
```

We can define a function f mapping a set of individuals to a characteristic function as well as a function h mapping a characteristic function to a set of individuals. 

```
f = lambda D lambda x : 1 iff x in D
h = lambda f : {x : f(x) = 1}
```

> Please conduct the following computation:
> ```
> f({x: x is a student}) =
> h(student_f) =
> ```

In this sense, sets of individuals and characteristic functions are $\color{red}{\text{isomorphic representations}}$ of the same meanings; the choice is about compositional convenience, not content. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> Isomorphism refers to a structure-preserving correspondence between two systems that may look different on the surface but are equivalent in all relevant structural respects.
> 
> - Two objects are isomorphic if there exists a mapping between them that is one-to-one, onto, and preserves the relations or operations that define their structure.
> - From the perspective of theory building, isomorphic structures are informationally equivalent: anything that can be stated or computed in one can be translated into the other without loss.
> 
> In formal semantics, this idea is crucial because it allows us to move freely between different representations, such as sets and functions, while treating them as notational variants of the same underlying meaning.

### Modification

Adjectives can modify common nouns, posing a challenge to our combinatory system. Can you see why? 

5. Obama is a male politician. 

In order to resolve the problem raised by adjective modification, we need to compare the truth conditions of the following sentences:

- Obama is male.
- Obama is a politician.
- Obama is a male politician. 

What we need: 

A new combination rule---Predicate Modification: $\displaystyle \frac{f :: a \rightarrow t \hspace{2cm} f' :: a \rightarrow t }{\lambda x. f(x) \wedge f'(x) :: a \rightarrow t }$

### Subsective adjectives 

Unfortunately, not all cases of adjective modification can be capturede by Predicate Modification. 

6. Obama is a young ex-president.
7. Jeremy Lin is a short basketball player.
8. Barbara Partee is a famous semanticist.

Can you spot the problem and figure out a solution?
