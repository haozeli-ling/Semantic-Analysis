# Model

So far, we have established that the intension of a sentence is its truth condition, which determines its extension—that is, its truth value—in a given time or situation. 

> To determine whether the sentence 'Sue danced' is true or false, you need to know: <br>
> - which person 'Sue' refers to;
> - whether this person danced.

We represent such information using an **abstract mathematical structure** called a *model*. A model is a formal mathematical representation of a specific situation or state of affairs.

## Denotation (semantic value) of sentences

For any model *M* and for any sentence *S*, $M$ tells you whether *S* is true or false.

It is conventional to use numbers, 1 and 0, instead of 'true' and 'false'. They are called 'truth values'. 1 means 'true', and 0 means 'false'.
- *S* denotes 1 or 0 in $M$. 
- the denotation of *S* is true or false in $M$.

**Notation:** $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = the denotation of the expression $\alpha$ in $M$. 

> $\alpha$ is a linguistic expression: <br>
> - Sentence: 'Sue danced', '老张爱喝酒', 'スーは踊った', etc. 
> - Verb Phrase: 'saw Mary', '爱喝酒', 'お酒が好き', etc. 
> - Noun Phrase: 'the man', '那个人', 'あの人', etc. 
> - Words, 'the', 'see', '人', '看', 'あの'， etc.  

If $\alpha$ is a sentence *S*, then: for any model $M$ and for any sentence *S*, $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = 1 or $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = 0. 

## Formal definition of a model

A model $M$ is an ordered pair $(A, F)$, where 
- $A$ is a set of objects. 
- $F$ is a function mapping a basic or primitive expression to its semantic value. 

> $M_1 = (A_1, F_1)$ <br>
> $A_1$ is a set of people. $F_1$ is defined as follows:
> - $F_1 (\textsf{s})$ = Sue
> - $F_1 (\textsf{p})$ = Peter
> - $F_1 (\textsf{j})$ = Jane
> - $F_1 (\text{dance}')$ = {Jane, Sue}
> - $F_1 (\text{sing}')$ = {Peter}

Given $M_1$, 
- $⟦\text{Sue}⟧^{M_1}$ = $F_1 (\text{s})$ = Sue
- $⟦\text{danced}⟧^{M_1}$ = $F_1 (\text{dance}')$ = {Jane, Sue}
- $⟦\text{Sue danced}⟧^{M_1}$ = 1

> #### Exercise
> $M_2 = (A_2, F_2)$ <br>
> $A_1$ is a set of states of the US. $F_1$ is defined as follows:
> - $F_1 (\textsf{mi})$ = Michigan
> - $F_1 (\textsf{ca})$ = California
> - $F_1 (\textsf{ge})$ = Georgia
> - $F_1 (\textsf{nm})$ = New Mexico
> - $F_1 (\textsf{or})$ = Oregon
> - $F_1 (\textsf{has-Pacific-coasts}')$ =
> - $F_1 (\textsf{has-Altantic-coasts}')$ =
> - $⟦\text{New Mexico}⟧^{M_2}$ =
> - $⟦\text{has Pacific coasts}⟧^{M_2}$ =
> - $⟦\text{New Mexico has Pacific coasts}⟧^{M_2}$ =
> - $⟦\text{California}⟧^{M_1}$ =

## Why models? 

A model can be seen as a simplified and abstract representation of how language connects to the external **reality**.
- The set $A$ in a model $(A, F)$ are those aspects of ‘reality’ that the semantics of the language is ‘sensitive to’. 
- The function $F$ in a model $(A, F)$ is akin to the ‘intentionality’ relation that holds between language and those aspects of the world. 

Model theory is the most successful method developed so far for studying the relationship between language and reality.

> 'Model-theoretic semantics is best understood as model-based science: a semantics for a natural language is a scientific [mathematical] model of truth conditions.' --- [Jackson (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02924-5)

One of the core activities of science is the construction and investigation of mathmatical models.
