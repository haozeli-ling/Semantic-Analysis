# Model

So far, we have established that the intension of a sentence is its truth condition, which determines its extension—that is, its truth value—in a given time or situation. 

> To determine whether the sentence 'Sue danced' is true or false, you need to know: <br>
> - which person 'Sue' refers to;
> - whether this person danced.

We represent such information using an **abstract mathematical structure** called a *model*. A model is a formal mathematical representation of a specific situation or state of affairs.

## Denotation (semantic value) of sentences

For any model *M* and for any sentence *S*, $M$ tells you whether *S* is true or false.

It is conventional to use numbers, 1 and 0, instead of 'true' and 'false'. They are called 'truth values'. 1 means 'true', and 0 means 'false'.
- *S* denotes 1 or 0 in $M$. 
- the denotation of *S* is true or false in $M$.

**Notation:** $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = the denotation of the expression $\alpha$ in $M$. 

> $\alpha$ is a linguistic expression, e.g.,
> Sentence: 'Sue danced', '老张爱喝酒', 'スーは踊った', etc.
