# Model

So far, we have established that the intension of a sentence is its truth condition, which determines its extension—that is, its truth value—in a given time or situation. 

> To determine whether the sentence 'Sue danced' is true or false, you need to know: <br>
> - which person 'Sue' refers to;
> - whether this person danced.

We represent such information using an **abstract mathematical structure** called a *model*. A model is a formal mathematical representation of a specific situation or state of affairs.

## Denotation (semantic value) of sentences

For any model *M* and for any sentence *S*, $M$ tells you whether *S* is true or false.

It is conventional to use numbers, 1 and 0, instead of 'true' and 'false'. They are called 'truth values'. 1 means 'true', and 0 means 'false'.
- *S* denotes 1 or 0 in $M$. 
- the denotation of *S* is true or false in $M$.

**Notation:** $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = the denotation of the expression $\alpha$ in $M$. 

> $\alpha$ is a linguistic expression: <br>
> - Sentence: 'Sue danced', '老张爱喝酒', 'スーは踊った', etc. 
> - Verb Phrase: 'saw Mary', '爱喝酒', 'お酒が好き', etc. 
> - Noun Phrase: 'the man', '那个人', 'あの人', etc. 
> - Words, 'the', 'see', '人', '看', 'あの'， etc.  

If $\alpha$ is a sentence *S*, then: for any model $M$ and for any sentence *S*, $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = 1 or $⟦\alpha⟧^M$ = 0. 

## Formal definition of a model

A model $M$ is an ordered pair $(A, F)$, where 
- $A$ is a set of objects. 
- $F$ is a function mapping a basic or primitive expression to its value. 

> For example <br>
> $M_1 = (A_1, F_1)$ <br>
> $A_1$ is a set of people. $F_1$ is defined as follows:
> - $F_1 (\textsf{s})$ = Sue
> - $F_1 (\textsf{p})$ = Peter
> - $F_1 (\textsf{j})$ = Jane
> - $F_1 (\text{dance})$ = {Jane, Sue}
> - $F_1 (\text{sing})$ = {Peter}
>   
> $⟦\text{Sue danced}⟧^M$ = 1

> #### Exercise
> $M_2 = (A_2, F_2)$ <br>
> $A_1$ is a set of states of the US. $F_1$ is defined as follows:
> - $F_1 (\textsf{mi})$ = Michigan
> - $F_1 (\textsf{ca})$ = California
> - $F_1 (\textsf{ge})$ = Georgia
> - $F_1 (\textsf{nm})$ = New Mexico
> - $F_1 (\textsf{or})$ = Oregon
> - $F_1 (\textsf{has Pacific coasts})$ =
> - $F_1 (\textsf{has Altantic coasts})$ =
> - $⟦\text{New Mexico has Pacific coasts}⟧^M$ =
