# Model

So far, we have established that the intension of a sentence is its truth condition, which determines its extension—that is, its truth value—in a given time or situation. 

> To determine whether the sentence 'Sue danced' is true or false, you need to know: <br>
> - which person 'Sue' refers to;
> - whether this person danced.

We represent such information using an **abstract mathematical structure** called a *model*. A model is a formal mathematical representation of a specific situation or state of affairs.

## Denotation (semantic value) of sentences

For any model *M* and for any sentence $\phi$, $M$ tells you whether $\phi$ is true or false.

It is conventional to use numbers, 1 and 0, instead of 'true' and 'false'. They are called 'truth values'. 1 means 'true', and 0 means 'false'.
