# Type 

Type theory is a formal framework used to classify entities into types to avoid ambiguities and inconsistencies in logic, programming, and linguistic analysis.

- Foundations of mathematics
- Programming languages and type systems
- **Formal semantics of natural language**: Provides a precise way to model the meanings of linguistic expressions and **explains grammaticality**.

### Basic Concepts

**Types**: A type specifies a category of entities that share common properties.

  - Examples: Natural numbers (ℕ), Boolean values (true, false), Strings, or propositions in logic.
  - In formal semantics, types can represent linguistic categories, such as ε for entities and t for truth values.
    
**Primitive types**: Entities and truth values

  - Type $e$: entities (or individuals)
  - Type $t$: truth values

**Function Types ($\rightarrow$)**: $a \rightarrow b$, here $a$ and $b$ are variables of types. 

  - Example: A predicate like "dance" can be typed as $e \rightarrow t$, mapping an entity to a truth value.
  - Note: in the literature, functional types are often represented as $\langle a, b \rangle$. However, in this course, we will stick to the $\rightarrow$ notation, as it better illustrates the deep connection between logic and functions. (Can you see why?)
    
**Product Types (×)**: $a \times b$, here $a$ and $b$ are variables of types.

  - Example: $e \times t$ represents pairs like (John, true).

### Typed Lambda Calculus and Compositional Semantics

- Variables: $x$, $y$, $z$
- Abstraction: $\lambda x_a. E_b$ (a function taking $x$ of type $a$ and returning $E$ of type $b$)
- Function Application: $\displaystyle \frac{f :: a \rightarrow b \hspace{2cm} x :: a}{f(x) :: b}$

**Examples**

- $⟦\text{Sue}⟧^M$ = $\text{s}$
  
  - Type: $e$
    
- $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M$ = $\lambda x.\text{danced}'(x)$
  
  - Type: $e \rightarrow t$

### Explaining grammaticality

According to the Function Application, a function of type $a \rightarrow b$ can only combine with an argument of type $a$. 

Note: The asterisk (*) indicates that the sentence following it is not grammatical/acceptable.

1. Trump danced.
   
   > the denotation of 'Trump' is an entity of type $e$; <br>
   > the denotation of 'danced' is a function of type $e \rightarrow t$; <br>
   > They can be combined via the Functional Application. <br>
   > Therefore, the sentence is grammatical. 

2. *Trump spoke danced.

   > the denotation of 'Trump spoke' is a proposition of type $t$; <br>
   > the denotation of 'danced' is a function of type $e \rightarrow t$; <br>
   > They cannot be combined via the Functional Application. <br>
   > Therefore, the sentence is ungrammatical.
