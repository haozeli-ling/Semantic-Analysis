# Pronouns and binding

Consider the following sentences, whose meanings are undetermined. 

1. **He** was old.
2. Terrance **did**, too.
3. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
4. **Such** people made me mad.

To determine the extensional meaning of an anaphoric expression such as 'he', 'so', 'such', or 'someone did', we need to know what its antecedent is, and we need to know the semantic rules that determine the meanings of the anaphoric expressions in terms of the values of their antecedents. 

5. **Biden** resigned because **he** was old.
6. Yitang Zhang **worked on the twin prime conjecture**, and Terrance **did**, too.
7. **Our salary may increase next year**. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
8. A **careless** driver backed into my car. **Such** people made me mad.

In (6), for example, the antecedent of the pronoun 'he' refers to an entity, and the pronoun refers to the same entity. This anaphoric linking is not always between entity-denoting expressions. From (6) through (8), the anaphoric expressions refer to elements with different types. 

The core issue we are addressing in this session is how to interpret pronouns or anaphoric expressions.
