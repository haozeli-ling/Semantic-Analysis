# Pronouns and binding

Consider the following sentences, whose meanings are undetermined. 

1. **He** was old.
2. Terrance **did**, too.
3. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
4. **Such** people made me mad.

To determine the extensional meaning of an anaphoric expression such as 'he', 'so', 'such', or 'someone did', we need to know what its antecedent is, and we need to know the semantic rules that determine the meanings of the anaphoric expressions in terms of the values of their antecedents. 

1'. Biden resigned because **he** was old.
2'. Yitang Zhang worked on the twin prime conjecture, and Terrance **did**, too.
3'. Our salary may increase next year. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
4'. A careless driver backed into my car. **Such** people made me mad.

In a simple case like John and he in (1a), the antecedent refers to an individual, and the pronoun refers to the same individual. The examples in (1b-d) show that anaphora is not always a relation between individual-denoting expressions, and example (1e) shows that even with pronominal anaphora, the anaphoric relation is not always a relation of “coreference”, as it seems to be in (1a).
