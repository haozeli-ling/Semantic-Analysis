# Pronouns and binding

Consider the following sentences, whose meanings are undetermined. 

1. **He** was old.
2. Terrance **did**, too.
3. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
4. **Such** people made me mad.

To determine the extensional meaning of an anaphoric expression such as 'he', 'so', 'such', or 'someone did', we need to know what its antecedent is, and we need to know the semantic rules that determine the meanings of the anaphoric expressions in terms of the values of their antecedents. 

5. **Biden** resigned because **he** was old.
6. Yitang Zhang **worked on the twin prime conjecture**, and Terrance **did**, too.
7. **Our salary may increase next year**. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
8. A **careless** driver backed into my car. **Such** people made me mad.

In (6), for example, the antecedent of the pronoun 'he' refers to an entity, and the pronoun refers to the same entity. This anaphoric linking is not always between entity-denoting expressions. From (6) through (8), the anaphoric expressions refer to elements with different types. 

The core issue we are addressing in this session is how to interpret pronouns or anaphoric expressions.

### Coreference, indices, and assignments

Context clearly has an effect on the informational content of a sentence. For example, the truth condition of a sentence with a pronoun shifts depending on the context, and so does the extensional meaning of a pronoun. 

 - In a context where I'm pointing at Donald Trump, 'he golfs' is true iff Donald Trump golfs.

   - $⟦\text{he}⟧^M = \text{t}$ in this context

 - In a context where I'm pointing at Joe Biden, 'he golfs' is true iff Joe Biden golfs.

   - $⟦\text{he}⟧^M = \text{b}$ in this context

 - In a context where I pointed first at Trump and then at Biden, 'he dislikes him' is true iff Trump dislikes Biden.

   - $⟦\text{he}⟧^M = \text{t}$ in this context
   - $⟦\text{him}⟧^M = \text{b}$ in this context

A pronoun can, in principle, refer to any entity, but it does not specify the conditions under which it refers to a particular one. To account for this, we introduce a new function into our algorithm.

**Assignment functions**: An assignment function $g$ is a (partial) function from natural numbers (indices) to the set of entities. 

> **Example** <br>
> $g = [1 \rightarrow \text{t}, 2 \rightarrow \text{b}, 3 \rightarrow \text{a}, ...]$

The index associated with an entity *x* can be thought of as a "memory slot" assigned to *x* throughout the conversation. In a sense, $g$ encapsulates part of the contextual information presupposed before the conversation begins.

The extensional meaning of a pronoun 'Pro' is assigned by an assignment function: 

- $⟦\text{Pro}_n⟧^{M,g} = g(n)$

> Given $g = [1 \rightarrow \text{t}, 2 \rightarrow \text{b}, 3 \rightarrow \text{a}, ...]$, ... <br>
> - $⟦\text{he}_1⟧^{M,g} = g(1) = \text{t}$
> - $⟦\text{he}_2⟧^{M,g} = g(2) = \text{b}$
> - $⟦\text{him}_2⟧^{M,g} = g(2) = \text{b}$

```
Exercise: Let's assume a new assignment function h = [1 -> obama, 2 -> biden, 3 -> alex, ...]
Who do the pronouns 'he_1' and 'he_2' refer to?
What is the truth value of the sentence 'he_1 dislikes him_2'?
```
