# Binding and abstraction 

We have established a specific rule for interpreting pronouns, such as . However, natural language contains various pronominal elements that do not always exhibit uniform properties.

Consider the following sentences with reflexive pronouns (henceforth, reflexives). 

1. Trump likes **himself**.
2. Sue saw a picture of **herself**.
3. You should never give up on **yourself**. 
4. ***Himself** likes Trump.
5. ***Herself** saw Sue's picture.
6. *Peter thinks that Sue likes **himself**. 

Reflexives cannot be freely used referentially. The understood antecedent of a reflexive must precede the reflexive in the same clause.
