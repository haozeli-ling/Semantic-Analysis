# Binding and abstraction 

We have established a specific rule for interpreting pronouns, such as . However, natural language contains various pronominal elements that do not always exhibit uniform properties.

Consider the following sentences with reflexive pronouns (henceforth, reflexives). 

1. Trump likes **himself**.
2. Sue saw a picture of **herself**.
3. You should never give up on **yourself**. 
4. ***Himself** likes Trump.
5. ***Herself** saw Sue's picture.
6. *Peter thinks that Sue likes **himself**. 

Reflexives cannot be freely used referentially. Their references always co-varies with their antecedent. The understood antecedent of a reflexive must precede the reflexive in the same clause. 

The co-variation pattern is comminly referred to as 'binding': a reflexive must be bound by its antecedent. 

```
Discussion: Can we use the rule established for interpreting pronouns to explain the properties of reflexives?

Given such an assignment function, g = [1 -> trump, 2 -> biden, 3 -> alex, ...]

Consider the following representations. Do they lead to the correct interpretations?

(a) Trump likes himself_1
(b) Trump likes himself_2
