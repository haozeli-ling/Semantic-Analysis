# 10. Definite descriptions

So far, our algorithm can handle the meaning of common nouns in predicate positions. However, the most typical position for common nouns is within phrases that serve as arguments. 

1. [A politician] arrived in DC.
2. People dislike [the politician].
3. [Many politicians] are liars.
4. [Politicians] are dishonest.

In this session, we will focus on the meanings of definite descriptions.

### Types of definite descriptions and the definite article

Let's determine the type of definite descriptions based on the inference of lambda deduction. 

5. The president imposed tariffs on Canada.

- For simplicity, we assume that "imposed tariffs on" is one single item denoting a function of type $e \rightarrow e \rightarrow t$, i.e., a transitive verb.
- It takes "Canada" as the object and "the president" as the subject to generate the extensional denotation of the whole sentence, which is of type $t$. 
- "Canada" denotes the country of type $e$.
- Therefore, "the president" must be of type $e$, even though we have not explicitly defined its lexical semantics.  

Given our previous discussion, the meaning of a common noun is a function of type $e \rightarrow t$. If "the president" is of type $e$, then the definite article "the" must be a function of type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow e$.  

```
F('the president') = F('the')(F('president')) = F('the')(lambda x : president_f(x))
                   = F('Donald Trump') = "t"
```

The function denoted by "the" maps the meaning of a common noun to a specific individual. How?

### Uniqueness condition

The key feature of definite descriptions is that their referent must be a unique individual in the given model.  

Let's re-consider the real-life scenario from G7 summit in 2018:

![Alt Text](https://github.com/haozeli-ling/Semantic-Analysis/blob/main/model.png)

If someone uttered "The president was discussing an important issue", how would you respond? --- Probably, you would say "which one?" This is because the scenaro includes more than one president, making it unclear which one the definite description refers to. 

By contrast, the sentence "The president was greeting us" is felicitous in the following scenario, where only one individual has the "president" property. 

![Alt Text](https://github.com/haozeli-ling/Semantic-Analysis/blob/main/model_2.png)

Generally, a definite description [the NP] is felicitous only when the domain of the extension of "NP" includes only one entity that is mapped to True. 

```
F('president') = lambda x : president_f(x) = ["t" -> 1, "m" -> 0, "v" -> 0, "u" -> 0]
Type: e -> t
```

Now, we can model the relation between the referent of a definite description [the NP] and the extension of [NP] using the uniqueness condition. 

```
F('the president') = the entity x such that president_f(x) = 1
```

### Felicity, truthfulness, and definedness

Intuitively, we may not want to claim that the sentence "the president was discussing an important issue" is false in the G7 summit scenario. Instead, we make a truth-value judgment only after identifying the referent of the definite description. This suggests that violating the uniqueness condition does not render the sentence false but rather results in a failure to assign a truth value. 

In this sense, the uniqueness condition of a definite description is not a truth condition, but rather a presupposition. In other words, this condition is assumed to hold before the sentence is uttered or its truth value is assessed. 

In our algorithm, we model presuppositions as **definedness conditions**. As a definedness condition, the failure of the uniqueness condition makes the whole sentence undefined, NOT false. "Undefined" can be considered a third possible value for a sentence, distinct from both True and False. 

- $⟦\text{the president}⟧^M$ = the entity $x$ **defined only if** $x$ is the unique entity such that $\text{president}'(x) = 1$ in $M$.

```
F('the president') = if | {x : president_f(x) = 1} | = 1 : the entity x such that president_f(x) = 1 
                     else undefined
``` 

Now, we are in a position to define the extensional meaning of the definite article:

```
iota(f) = if | {x : f(x) = 1} | = 1 : the entity x such that f(x) = 1
          else undefined

F('the') = lambda f : iota(f)
Type: (e -> t) -> e
``` 

> Discussion: Can we incorportate the uniqueness condition into the meaning of a common noun?

### Definedness conditions in composition 

A sentence with a definite description has a defined truth condition only when the definite description is defined. 

```
F('the president blamed Canada') = F('blamed')(F('Canada'))(F('the president'))
                                 = [lambda y : lambda x : blamed_f(x,y)]("c")(iota(president_f))
                                 = blamed_f(iota(president_f), "c")
``` 

> Exercise: Compute the extensional meaning of the following sentence.
> 
> a. The King greeted the bishop.
