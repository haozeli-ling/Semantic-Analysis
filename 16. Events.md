# Events

We have developed an analysis for adjectives and modification, under which adjectives denote functions of type $e \rightarrow t$ and modify common nouns through the Predicate Modification rule. 

Predicate Modification: $\displaystyle \frac{f :: a \rightarrow t \hspace{2cm} f' :: a \rightarrow t }{\lambda x. f(x) \wedge f'(x) :: a \rightarrow t }$

$⟦\text{male politician}⟧^{g,M} = \lambda x. \text{male}'(x) \wedge \text{politician}'(x)$ 

Adjectives aren’t the only kind of modifier in natural language. There are also adverbs, which modify verb phrases. 

1. Dave walked **quickly**.
2. Dave walked **around Hive**.
3. Dave walked **after 5pm**.

What do adverbs denote? How do they modify verb phrases? 

Adverbs cannot share the same kind of denotation with adjectives; assuming otherwise would lead to absurd interpretations:  

- Assume: $⟦\text{after 5pm}⟧^{g,M} = \lambda x. \text{after-5pm}'(x)$ (Type: $e \rightarrow t$)
- Then $⟦\text{Dave walked after 5pm}⟧^{g,M} = \text{walk}'(\text{d}) \wedge \text{after-5pm}'(\text{d})$
- Dave was after 5pm ???

```
Discussion: Do you have alternative ideas for modeling the meaning of adverbs?

### Introducing events

Ever since the work of Davidson (1967), philosophers and linguists have found the following hypotheses to be extremely productive: 

- The core meaning of a verb is characterizing an event.
- The meaning of a sentence is a truth condition on an event.
- Adverbs semantically modify events described by verbs.

An intuitive demonstration

4. Daisy hugged Gatsby tightly in the living room yesterday. 

> The event described by Sentence 4: 
> 
> - Event: hugging
> - Agent: Daisy
> - Theme: Gatsby
> - Manner: tightly
> - Location: the living room
> - Time: yesterday

Note: 'Agent', 'theme', 'location', 'time', and 'manner' are commonly referred to as thematic roles, which also include roles such as 'instrument', 'beneficiary', and 'recipient'.

We can write the truth condition of Sentence 4 using events: 

> Sentence 4 is true iff there is an event $e$ such that:
> - $e$ is a hugging event, and
> - the agent of $e$ is Daisy, and
> - the theme of $e$ is Gatsby, and
> - the manner of $e$ is tightly, and
> - the location of $e$ is the living room, and
> - the time of $e$ is yesterday
