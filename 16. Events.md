We have developed an analysis for adjectives and modification, under which adjectives denote functions of type $e \rightarrow t$ and modify common nouns through the Predicate Modification rule. 

Predicate Modification: $\displaystyle \frac{f :: a \rightarrow t \hspace{2cm} f' :: a \rightarrow t }{\lambda x. f(x) \wedge f'(x) :: a \rightarrow t }$

$⟦\text{male politician}⟧^{g,M} = \lambda x. \text{male}'(x) \wedge \text{politician}'(x)$ 

Adjectives aren’t the only kind of modifier in natural language. There are also adverbs, which modify verb phrases. 

1. Dave walked **quickly**.
2. Dave walked **around Hive**.
3. Dave walked **after 5pm**.

What do adverbs denote? How do they modify verb phrases?
