We have developed an analysis for adjectives and modification, under which adjectives denote functions of type $e \rightarrow t$ and modify common nouns through the Predicate Modification rule. 

Predicate Modification: $\displaystyle \frac{f :: a \rightarrow t \hspace{2cm} f' :: a \rightarrow t }{\lambda x. f(x) \wedge f'(x) :: a \rightarrow t }$

$⟦\text{male politician}⟧^{g,M} = \lambda x. \text{male}'(x) \wedge \text{politician}'(x)$
