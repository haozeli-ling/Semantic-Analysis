# Big Picture: Compositionality 

## The goal of a semantic theory

A precise, formal theory of a specific subcomponent of the human cognitive capacity: the capacity to productively interpret the infinite sentences of natural languages. 

#### Some constraints on the theory 

- The theory must accurately interpret all the **infinitely** many well-formed sentences of a human language.
- The hypothesized system must account for why humans can acquire a language **at a very young age with limited input data**, especially when compared to the extensive data requirements of large language models.
  > Human vs. LLM 

#### Basic structure

The hypothesized system (algorithm) must be a **combinatorial** system, consisting of:
- A finite set of primitive meaningful units, i.e., **lexical items**.
- A finite set of **rules** that derive the meaning of complex expressions based on the meanings of these primitives and the structure of the expressions.

#### Basic facts

As for a sentence *S*, replacing some words or altering the word order can produce a new sentence *S'*, which conveys a different meaning.
1. Sue likes Peter.
2. Sue hates Peter.
3. Peter likes Sue.

##  The Principle of Compositionality 
The meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts and its structure. 

> Example <br>
> - We know the meaning of the sentence, e.g. 'The man saw Mary'. <br>
> - According to the Principle of Compositionality, the truth-condition of the sentence is determined by the meaning of 'the man', the meaning of 'saw Mary', and how they are combined. <br>
> - Furthermore, the meaning of 'the man' is determined by the meaning of 'the', the meaning of 'man', and how they are combined. 

## Research question
What combinatorial system or algorithm does our cognitive architecture use to compute the meanings of complex expressions from the meanings of their individual components? 

## Research Method

- Develop an algorithm that computes meaning in a compositional manner.
- Compare the results of the algorithm to the actual performance of human languages and human cognition.
- To the extent that they align, we may have an accurate representation of the system we aim to understand.
