# Relative clauses (Discussion)

With assignments and abstraction, we can interprete the meaning of relative clauses in English. 

1. **The sandwich [that I left in the fridge last week]** has developed its own ecosystem.
2. **The person [who invented Mondays]** clearly had a personal vendetta against happiness.
3. **The meeting [that could have been an email]** has ruined my entire afternoon.
4. **The professor [who made jokes as ancient as his lecture notes]** still laughs harder at them than the students do.

Assumptions: 

- The relative markers like 'that', 'which', and 'who' has the same meaning as 'such that' as discussed in Lecture Note 11.
- A relative clause contains a gap linking to the head noun.

  - the [sandwich] [that I left $[e]$ in the fridge last week]
  - Head noun: 'sandwich'
  - Relative clause: 'that I left in the fridge last week'

- The gap is assumed to be a null pronoun indexed with the relative marker.

  - the [sandwich] [ $\text{that}_1$ I left $[e]_1$ in the fridge last week]

Given these assumptions, provide the denotations for the following lexical items: 

- $⟦[e]_1⟧ =$
- $⟦\text{that}_1\ X⟧ =$

Derive the meaning for the following expression: 

- $⟦\text{the sandwich}\ \text{that}_1\ \text{I left}\ [e]_1⟧ =$

For composition, follow this structure: Crucially, combine the meaning of the relative clause with that of the head noun, rather than with the meaning of the definite description.
