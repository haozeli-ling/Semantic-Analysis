# Relative clauses (Discussion)

With assignments and abstraction, we can interprete the meaning of relative clauses in English. 

1. **The sandwich [that I left in the fridge last week]** has developed its own ecosystem.
2. **The person [who invented Mondays]** clearly had a personal vendetta against happiness.
3. **The meeting [that could have been an email]** has ruined my entire afternoon.
4. **The professor [who made jokes as ancient as his lecture notes]** still laughs harder at them than the students do.

Assumptions: 

- The relative markers like 'that', 'which', and 'who' has the same meaning as 'such that', which we have discussed in Lecture Note 11.
- A relative clause contains a gap linking to the head noun.

  - the [sandwich] [that I left in [$e$] the fridge last week]
