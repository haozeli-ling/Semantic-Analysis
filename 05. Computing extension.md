# Computing extensions

Now, we are in a position to initiate our building of an algorithm to compute meaning. 

> Intuition:
> Semantic Value of 'Sue' + Semantic Value of 'danced' = Semantic Value of 'Sue danced'
> Given a model $M$, ⟦Sue⟧$^M$ + ⟦danced⟧$^M$ = ⟦Sue danced⟧$^M$ = the truth value of 'Sue danced' in $M$.
