# Computing extensions

Now, we are in a position to initiate our building of an algorithm to compute meaning. 

> Intuition: <br>
> Semantic Value of 'Sue' + Semantic Value of 'danced' = Semantic Value of 'Sue danced' <br>
> Given a model $M$, ⟦Sue⟧$^M$ + ⟦danced⟧$^M$ = ⟦Sue danced⟧$^M$ = the truth value of 'Sue danced' in $M$.

What we have known is:
- $⟦\text{Sue}⟧^M$ = $\text{s}$
- $⟦\text{Sue danced}⟧^M$ = 1 (suppose  $\text{s} \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq M$)

Our task is to resolve the following equation:
- $\text{s} + ⟦\text{danced}⟧^M = 1$

## Extension of predicates = functions 

Based on the equation, the extension of the predicate *danced* must be able to combine with the object $\text{s}$ to yield the truth value. 

Mathematically, given a set such as { $x$ | $x$ danced }, we can define a characteristic function $f$: 
- $f(x) = x \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced }
