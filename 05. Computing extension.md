# Computing extensions

Now, we are in a position to initiate our building of an algorithm to compute meaning. 

> Intuition: <br>
> Semantic Value of 'Sue' + Semantic Value of 'danced' = Semantic Value of 'Sue danced' <br>
> Given a model $M$, ⟦Sue⟧$^M$ + ⟦danced⟧$^M$ = ⟦Sue danced⟧$^M$ = the truth value of 'Sue danced' in $M$.

What we have known is:
- ⟦Sue⟧$^M$ = $\text{s}$
- ⟦Sue danced$⟧^M$ = 1 (suppose  $\text{s} \in$ { $x$ | $x$ danced } $\subseteq M$)
