# Transitive verbs

The meaning of an intransitive verb is typically defined as a function that maps an entity to a truth value. This naturally raises the question: what is the meaning of transitive verbs? The key distinction between these two types of verbs lies in their argument structure: an intransitive verb takes only one argument, while a transitive verb takes two.

> 1. Trump danced.
> 2. Trump dislikes Biden.
> 3. *Trump dislikes. 

Note: The asterisk (*) indicates that the sentence following it is not grammatical/acceptable. 

Consequently, defining an intransitive verb as a function from entities to truth values aligns with its structural properties—providing it with an entity yields a truth value relative to a model, representing the extensional meaning of a sentence.

> $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M = \lambda x. \text{danced}'(x)$ <br>
> $⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M = \text{t}$ <br>
> $⟦\text{Trump danced}⟧^M = ⟦\text{danced}⟧^M(⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M)$

However, a transitive verb cannot be defined in the same way, as it requires two arguments to form a sentence. Given a sentence *S* with a transitive verb $TV$, since the extensional meaning of *S* is its truth value in a model, we can infer that the meaning of $TV$ is a function that maps two entities to a truth value.  

            S                              
           / \
         NP   VP              
         |    / \
      Trump  V   NP
             |    |
          dislikes Biden

- $⟦\text{S}⟧^M = ⟦\text{VP}⟧^M (⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M) = [⟦\text{dislikes}⟧^M ( ⟦\text{Biden}⟧^M )] (⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M) $
  
  - The type of $⟦\text{S}⟧^M$ is $t$.
  - The type of $⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M$ is $e$.
  - The type of $⟦\text{Biden}⟧^M$ is $e$.
  - If $⟦\text{S}⟧^M = ⟦\text{VP}⟧^M (⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M)$ and $⟦\text{VP}⟧^M (⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M)$ is of type $t$, then $⟦\text{VP}⟧^M$ must be of type $e \rightarrow t$. 
  - If $⟦\text{VP}⟧^M = ⟦\text{dislikes}⟧^M ( ⟦\text{Biden}⟧^M$) and $⟦\text{VP}⟧^M$ is of type $e \rightarrow t$, then $⟦\text{dislikes}⟧^M$ must be of type $e \rightarrow e \rightarrow t$.

Then, how should such a function be defined?

## Relations

The extensional meaning of a transitive verb can be understood as a set of pairs. Consider the following real-life scenario from G7 summit in 2018:

Let's focus on five political leaders: Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump. 

- In mathematics, a relation denotes some kind of relationship between two objects in a set. Formally, a relation $R$ over a set $X$ can be seen as a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of members of $X$.
- Given the scenario from G7, a 'looking-at' relation can be modeled as such a set:  

  - $A'$ = { ($\text{trump}$, $\text{merkel}$), ($\text{merkel}$, $\text{trump}$), ($\text{trudeau}$, $\text{trump}$), ($\text{macron}$, $\text{doc}$- $\alpha$), ($\text{may}$, $\text{doc}$- $\alpha$) }
  - The set $A'$ can be re-written as: {$(x,y) \mid x\ \tn{looked at}\ y$}

This set can be transformed into a characteristic function that map pairs to truth values. 

- $⟦\text{looked at}⟧^M$ = $\lambda (x,y) \in A \times A$. 1 iff $(x, y) \in$ {$(x,y) \mid x\ \tn{looked at}\ y$}
