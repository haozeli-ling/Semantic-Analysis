# Generalized Quantifiers: Type

Presently, our system can interpret sentences where the following sorts of nominal expressions occupy subject and object positions:

- **Proper Names:** Barack, Joe, Michelle  
- **Definite descriptions:** the man, the president

All of the above DPs are of type $e$. What about the following quantificational expressions (henceforth, **quantifiers**)? 

1. **Every apple** is on the table.
2. Annie ate **some apples**.
3. George saw **three deers**.
4. Sue read **most novels**. 

Two issues:

- A definite description or proper name refers to an individual, with its meaning defined by its reference. Do quantifiers have references? 
- The quantity expressions have the same distribution as definite descriptions and proper names. Do the former share the same type with the latter?

### Reference

### Semantics type

Looking at the structure of sentences above, there are two logical possibilities regarding the semantic type of these DPs:

        S
       /  \
      DP    VP
     /  \    |
    D    NP   V
   Every  N  smokes
         man


Possible Semantic Types

1. **Possibility 1:** The DPs are type $e$  
2. **Possibility 2:** The DPs are type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$  

#### Challenge

So far, we’ve treated nominal expressions in subject position as expressions of type $e$. However, we cannot continue to do so here.   

**Argument 1**
 
- Suppose we have two VPs – VP1 and VP2 – such that for all $x$, if $⟦\text{VP1}⟧^{M,g} (x)$ is true, then $⟦\text{VP2}⟧^{M,g} (x)$ is true.   
- Suppose that we have an NP of type $e$.  
- It follows that if $⟦\text{NP VP1}⟧^{M,g}$ is true, then $⟦\text{NP VP2}⟧^{M,g}$ is true.  
- The following **does not** hold:
  
  - if $⟦\text{no man smokes Marlboros}⟧^{M,g}$ is true, then $⟦\text{no man smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ is true.  

- Conclusion: 'no man' is not of type $e$.  

**Argument 2**
  
- If $⟦\text{NP VP1}⟧^{M,g}$ is true iff $⟦\text{NP VP2}⟧^{M,g}$ is false, then for an NP of type $e$, the relationship must always hold.  
- The following does not hold for quantifiers. 

  - $⟦\text{a/some man smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ and $⟦\text{a/some man doesn’t smoke}⟧^{M,g}$ can both be true.   

- Conclusion: 'a/some man' is not of type $e$.  

**Argument 3**
  
- Suppose that for all $x$, $⟦\text{VP1}⟧^{M,g} (x)$ is true iff $⟦\text{VP2}⟧^{M,g} (x)$ is false.
- For an NP of type $e$, $⟦\text{NP VP1 or NP VP2}⟧^{M,g}$ should always be true. 
- The following is **not necessarily true** for quantifiers.
  
  - Every man smokes or every man doesn’t smoke. 

- Conclusion: 'every man' is not of type $e$.  

From the previous arguments, we conclude:

- None of the following DPs are of type $e$: 'a/some man', 'no man', 'every man'.  
- Therefore, these DPs are of type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$.
