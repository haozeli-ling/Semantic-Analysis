# Model-Theoretic Semantics

## Big picture 

### The goal of a semantic theory

A precise, formal theory of a specific subcomponent of the human cognitive capacity: the capacity to productively interpret the infinite sentences of natural languages. 

### Some constraints on the theory 

1. The theory must accurately interpret all the **infinitely** many well-formed sentences of a human language.
2. The hypothesized system must account for why humans can acquire a language **at a very young age with limited input data**, especially when compared to the extensive data requirements of large language models.
3. the hypothesized system must be some kind of ‘recursive’ / ‘combinatoric’ system, one that comprises:  a. b. A finite number of primitive meaningful units (lexemes, lexical items) A finite set of ‘rules’ for deriving the meaning of a complex expression from the meanings of the primitives and the structure of the complex expression 

### Basic structure

The hypothesized system must be a **combinatorial** system, consisting of:
1. A finite set of primitive meaningful units, i.e., **lexical items**.
2. A finite set of **rules** that derive the meaning of complex expressions based on the meanings of these primitives and the structure of the expressions.
