# Model-Theoretic Semantics

## Big picture 

### The goal of a semantic theory

A precise, formal theory of a specific subcomponent of the human cognitive capacity: the capacity to productively interpret the infinite sentences of natural languages. 

### Some Constraints on the Form of the Theory 

1. The theory must accurately interpret all the **infinitely** many well-formed sentences of a human language.
2. The hypothesized system must account for why humans can acquire a language **at a very young age with limited input data**, especially when compared to the extensive data requirements of large language models.
