# Compositionality and Model-Theoretic Semantics

## Big picture 

### The goal of a semantic theory

A precise, formal theory of a specific subcomponent of the human cognitive capacity: the capacity to productively interpret the infinite sentences of natural languages. 

### Some constraints on the theory 

- The theory must accurately interpret all the **infinitely** many well-formed sentences of a human language.
- The hypothesized system must account for why humans can acquire a language **at a very young age with limited input data**, especially when compared to the extensive data requirements of large language models.

### Basic structure

The hypothesized system must be a **combinatorial** system, consisting of:
- A finite set of primitive meaningful units, i.e., **lexical items**.
- A finite set of **rules** that derive the meaning of complex expressions based on the meanings of these primitives and the structure of the expressions.

### Basic facts

As for a sentence *S*, replacing some words or altering the word order can produce a new sentence *S'*, which conveys a different meaning.
1. Sue likes Peter.
2. Sue hates Peter.
3. Peter likes Sue.  

> **The Principle of Compositionality** <br>
> The meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts and its structure.
