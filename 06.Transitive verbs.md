# Transitive verbs

The meaning of an intransitive verb is typically defined as a function that maps an entity to a truth value. This naturally raises the question: what is the meaning of transitive verbs? The key distinction between these two types of verbs lies in their argument structure: an intransitive verb takes only one argument, while a transitive verb takes two.

> 1. Trump danced.
> 2. Trump dislike Biden.
> 3. *Trump dislike. 

Note: The asterisk (*) indicates that the sentence following it is not grammatical/acceptable. 

Consequently, defining an intransitive verb as a function from entities to truth values aligns with its structural properties—providing it with an entity yields a truth value relative to a model, representing the extensional meaning of a sentence.

> $⟦\text{danced}⟧^M = \lambda x. \text{danced}'(x)$ <br>
> $⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M = \text{t}$ <br>
> $⟦\text{Trump danced}⟧^M = ⟦\text{danced}⟧^M(⟦\text{Trump}⟧^M)$

However, a transitive verb cannot be defined in the same way, as it requires two arguments to form a sentence. Given a sentence *S* with a transitive verb $TV$, since the extensional meaning of *S* is its truth value in a model, we can infer that the meaning of $TV$ is a function that maps two entities to a truth value. Then, how should such a function be defined? 

            S
           / \
         NP   VP
         |    / \
      Trump  V   NP
             |    |
          dislikes Biden
