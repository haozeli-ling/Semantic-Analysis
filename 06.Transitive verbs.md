# Transitive verbs

The meaning of an intransitive verb is typically defined as a function that maps an entity to a truth value. This naturally raises the question: what is the meaning of transitive verbs? The key distinction between these two types of verbs lies in their argument structure: an intransitive verb takes only one argument, while a transitive verb takes two.

> 1. Trump danced.
> 2. Trump dislike Biden.
> 3. *Trump dislike. 

Note: The asterisk (*) indicates that the sentence following it is not grammatical/acceptable. 

As a consequence, defining an intransitive verb as a function from entitys to truth values indeed matches its structural property. 

> $⟦\text{dance}⟧^M = \lambda x. \text{danced}'(x)$
