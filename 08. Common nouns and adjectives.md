# Common nouns and adjectives

This session is devoted to the extensional meanings of common nouns and adjectives. Let's use Typed Lambda Calculus to work out their denotations together.

### Predicative uses

Common nouns and adjectives can be used to form predicates, expressing properties attributed to individuals.   

1. Obama is a politician.
2. Obama is male.

What we know: 

|  Denotation  | Type    |
|----------|----------|
| $⟦\text{Obama}⟧^M = \text{o}$ | $e$ | 
 

What we need to determine:  

|  Denotation  | Type    |
|----------|----------|
| $⟦\text{politician}⟧^M = $ |  |
| $⟦\text{male}⟧^M = $ |  |
| $⟦\text{is}⟧^M = $ |   |
| $⟦\text{a}⟧^M = $   |    |

In order to determine the denotations of the copula and the article "a", we should consider the following facts:

- In some elementary schools in the US, the copula "is" is referred to as a "helping verb." It carries no inherent meaning but simply "helps" adjectives and nouns function as predicates.
- Consider the following Mandarin examples: 

3. 奥巴马 是 政客。
   Obama is politician
