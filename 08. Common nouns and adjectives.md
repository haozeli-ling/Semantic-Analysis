# Common nouns and adjectives

This session is devoted to the extensional meanings of common nouns and adjectives. Let's use Typed Lambda Calculus to work out their denotations together.

### Predicative uses

Common nouns and adjectives can be used to form predicates, expressing properties attributed to individuals.   

1. Obama is a politician.
2. Obama is male.

Step 1: What are the structures of these two sentences?

Step 2: What is the denotation of each word in these sentences? 

What we know: 

|  Denotation  | Type    |
|----------|----------|
| $⟦\text{Obama}⟧^M = \text{o}$ | $e$ | 
 

What we need to determine:  

|  Denotation  | Type    |
|----------|----------|
| $⟦\text{politician}⟧^M = $ |  |
| $⟦\text{male}⟧^M = $ |  |
| $⟦\text{is}⟧^M = $ |   |
| $⟦\text{a}⟧^M = $   |    |

In order to determine the denotations of the copula and the article "a", we should take the following facts into account:

- In some elementary schools in the US, the copula "is" is referred to as a "helping verb." It carries no inherent meaning but simply "helps" adjectives and nouns function as predicates.
- Compare the following Mandarin sentences with their English counterparts. What elements are missing in the Mandarin examples?   

3. 奥巴马 是 政客。<br>
   Obama is politician [gloss] <br>
   Obama is a politician [English counterpart]
   
4. 奥巴马 高，   姚明      更   高。 <br>
   Obama tall  Yao Ming more tall [gloss] <br>
   Obama is tall. Yao Ming is taller. [English counterpart]

### Modification

Adjectives can modify common nouns, posing a challenge to our combinatory system. Can you see why? 

5. Obama is a male politician. 

In order to resolve the problem raised by adjective modification, we need to compare the truth conditions of the following sentences:

- Obama is male.
- Obama is a politician.
- Obama is a male politician. 

What we need: 

A new combination rule---Predicate Modification: <br>
$\displaystyle \frac{f :: a \rightarrow t \hspace{2cm} f' :: a \rightarrow t }{\lambda x. f(x) \wedge f'(x) :: a \rightarrow t }$
