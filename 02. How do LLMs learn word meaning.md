### How do LLMs learn word meaning

Before diving into our computational model for meaning, let's take a quick glimpse at the algorithms behind Large Language Models (LLMs). Then, we will compare the LLM approach with the one we are going to design, so you can decide which offers a more intuitive understanding of language meaning.
