# Semantic Analysis

Welcome to the website for *Semantics Analysis*. This course builds on the foundational concepts introduced in *Semantics & Pragmatics*, with a specialized focus on compositional semantics—the study of how complex meanings are systematically constructed from the meanings of smaller components and the rules governing their combination. 

Throughout the course, we will investigate how compositionality interacts with syntax to generate meaning, analyze linguistic phenomena through formal semantic frameworks, and scrutinize the theoretical foundations of compositional semantics. By the end of this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of compositional semantics and its central role in explaining the structure and interpretation of natural language.  

Below is an up-to-date overview of our schedule, with links to notes from class where applicable.

This course includes some basic mathematical tools, which have been compiled into a [one-page handout](https://github.com/haozeli-ling/Semantic-Analysis/blob/main/notes_formal_tools.pdf) for your reference. Additionally, you can further familiarize yourself with these tools using the following resources:
- **Sets, relations, and functions**: It can be found in any introductory resources on [Discrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics), such as books, articles, or YouTube videos. Personally, I find [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Trevtutor/featured) fascinating—--it features clips that introduce formal concepts and even touch on topics relevant to this course. 
- **Lambda Calculus and Type**: Lambda Calculus is a powerful formal language for defining functions. [The Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) offers a clear introduction to this formalism. If reading a technical article feels overwhelming, you might enjoy [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViPNHMSUcog&t=406s), which introduces Lambda Calculus in a more engaging and dynamic way. These resources will also highlight the strong connections between mathematics, formal semantics, logic, and programming.
