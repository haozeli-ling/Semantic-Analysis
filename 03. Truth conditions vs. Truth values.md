# Truth conditions vs. Truth values

Our current goal is essentially to develop an algorithm that compositionally derives assertions or truth conditions of sentences. 

> For example <br>
>
> Meaning of 'Sue' + Meaning of 'danced' = Meaning of 'Sue danced' = Truth condition of 'Sue danced' <br>
> 
> Then, what is the meaning of 'Sue'? What is the meaning of 'danced'? And how are they combined to generate the truth condition of `Sue danced'? 

## Extension vs. Intension 

What is the meaning of 'the Prime Minister of Singapore"? 

- In one sense, its meaning could change over time. In 2022, it refers to 'Lee Hsien Loong', while in 2025, it refers to 'Lawrence Wong'.
- In other sense, its meaning is stable. In both 2022 and 2024, it means 'the CEO of the Singapore government'.
