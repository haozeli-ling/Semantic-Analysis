# Truth conditions vs. Truth values

Our current goal is essentially to develop an algorithm that compositionally derives assertions or truth conditions of sentences. 

> For example <br>
>
> Meaning of 'Sue' + Meaning of 'danced' = Meaning of 'Sue danced' = Truth condition of 'Sue danced' <br>
> 
> Then, what is the meaning of 'Sue'? What is the meaning of 'danced'? And how are they combined to generate the truth condition of `Sue danced'? 

## Extension vs. Intension 

What is the meaning of 'the Prime Minister of Singapore"? 

- In one sense, its meaning could change over time. In 2022, it refers to 'Lee Hsien Loong', while in 2025, it refers to 'Lawrence Wong'.
- In another sense, its meaning is stable. In both 2022 and 2024, it means 'the CEO of the Singapore government'.

What are the meanings of 'the evening star' and 'the morning star'? 

- In one sense, they have the same meaning, as both refer to the planet Venas.
- In another sense, they differ in meaning. The morning star refers to the star visible in the east before sunrise, while the evening star refers to the star visible in the west after sunset.

The meaning of a nominal expression N can be divided into its **extension** and its **intension**. 

- Extension: the thing in the actual world that N refers to.
- Intension: the ‘general concept’ behind N, which determines (for a given time/situation) what the extension of N is. 

## What about sentence meaning? 

The **intension of a sentence** can be understood as (something like) its truth conditions.
