# Truth conditions vs. Truth values

Our current goal is essentially to develop an algorithm that compositionally derives assertions or truth conditions of sentences. 

> For example <br>
> Meaning of 'Sue' + Meaning of 'danced' = Meaning of 'Sue danced' = Truth condition of 'Sue danced'
> Then, what is the meaning of 'Sue'? What is the meaning of 'danced'? And how are they combined to generate the truth condition of `Sue danced'?
