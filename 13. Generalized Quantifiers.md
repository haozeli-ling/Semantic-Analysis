# Generalized Quantifiers


## 1. Introduction

Presently, our system can interpret sentences where the following sorts of DPs occupy subject position:

- **Proper Names:** Barack, Joe, Michelle  
- **Definite DPs:** the man, the president  

### Observations

1. **All of the above DPs are of type `e`.**  
2. **These aren’t the only kinds of DPs that can occupy subject position.**  
   - All the following DPs, for which we don’t yet have a semantics, can also occupy subject position:

### Some Quantificational DPs

| DP Type  | Example Sentence |
|----------|-----------------|
| A / some man | A / some man smokes. |
| No man | No man smokes. |
| Every man | Every man smokes. |
| Three men | Three men smoke. |
| Many men | Many men smoke. |
| Few men | Few men smoke. |
| Most men | Most men smoke. |

### Key Observation

- If we extend our system to provide a treatment of these DPs, we’ll have the tools to interpret just about any DP in the English language!  
- We’ll start with the first three (`a`, `b`, `c`) and then expand from there.  

## 2. The Type of Quantificational DPs

Looking at the structure of sentences above, there are two logical possibilities regarding the semantic type of these DPs:
