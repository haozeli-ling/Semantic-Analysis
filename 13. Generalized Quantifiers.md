# Generalized Quantifiers


## 1. Introduction

Presently, our system can interpret sentences where the following sorts of DPs occupy subject position:

- **Proper Names:** Barack, Joe, Michelle  
- **Definite descriptions:** the man, the president  

### Observations

1. All of the above DPs are of type $e$.
2. These aren’t the only kinds of DPs that can occupy subject position.
    
   - All the following DPs, for which we don’t yet have a semantics, can also occupy subject position:

### Some Quantificational DPs

| DP Type  | Example Sentence |
|----------|-----------------|
| A / some man | A / some man smokes. |
| No man | No man smokes. |
| Every man | Every man smokes. |
| Three men | Three men smoke. |
| Many men | Many men smoke. |
| Few men | Few men smoke. |
| Most men | Most men smoke. |

### Key Observation

- If we extend our system to provide a treatment of these DPs, we’ll have the tools to interpret just about any DP in the English language!  
- We’ll start with the first three (`a`, `b`, `c`) and then expand from there.  

## 2. The Type of Quantificational DPs

Looking at the structure of sentences above, there are two logical possibilities regarding the semantic type of these DPs:






Possible Semantic Types

1. **Possibility 1:** The DPs are type `e`  
2. **Possibility 2:** The DPs are type `<et,t>`  

#### Challenge

So far, we’ve treated nominal expressions in subject position as expressions of type $e$. However, we cannot continue to do so here.   

#### **Argument 1**

**Generalization:**  
- Suppose we have two VPs – VP1 and VP2 – such that for all `x`, if `[[VP1]](x) = T` then `[[VP2]](x) = T`.  
- Suppose that we have a NP of type $e$.  
- It follows that if `[[ NP VP1 ]] = T`, then `[[ NP VP2 ]] = T`.  

**Key Observation:**  

- The following **does not** hold:  
  - `if [[no man smokes Marlboros]] = T, then [[no man smokes]] = T`  

**Conclusion:** `no man` is not of type `e`.  

#### **Argument 2**

**Generalization:**  
- If `[[ DP VP1 ]] = T` iff `[[ DP VP2 ]] = F`, then for a DP of type `e`, the relationship must always hold.  

**Key Observation:**  
- The following does not hold:  
  - `[[a/some man smokes]] = T` and `[[a/some man doesn’t smoke]] = T` can both be true.  

**Conclusion:** `a / some man` is not of type `e`.  

#### **Argument 3**

**Generalization:**  
- Suppose that for all `x`, `[[VP1]](x) = T` iff `[[VP2]](x) = F`.  
- For a DP of type `e`, `[[ [ DP VP1 ] or [ DP VP2 ] ]]` should always be `T`.  

**Key Observation:**  
- The following is **not necessarily true**:  
  - *Every man smokes or every man doesn’t smoke.*  

**Conclusion:** `every man` is not of type `e`.  

## 3. The Semantics of Quantificational DPs and Ds

From the previous arguments, we conclude:

- **None of the following DPs are of type `e`:** *a/some man*, *no man*, *every man*.  
- **Therefore, these DPs are of type `<et,t>`.**  

### **Core Intuition**

- These DPs take `<et>` properties and return a truth value.
- They are predicates of predicates (second-order predicates).  

### **Formal Representation**

```lambda
a. [[ no man ]] =  [ λf<et> : there is no man x such that f(x) = T ]
b. [[ a/some man]] = [ λf<et> : there is some man x such that f(x) = T ]
c. [[ every man]] = [ λf<et> : for all x, if x is a man, then f(x) = T ]
