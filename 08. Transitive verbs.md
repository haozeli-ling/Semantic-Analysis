# 08. Transitive verbs

The meaning of an intransitive verb is typically defined as a function that maps an entity to a truth value. This naturally raises the question: what is the meaning of transitive verbs? The key distinction between these two types of verbs lies in their argument structure: an intransitive verb takes only one argument, while a transitive verb takes two.

> 1. Trump danced.
> 2. Trump dislikes Biden.
> 3. *Trump dislikes. 

Consequently, defining an intransitive verb as a function from entities to truth values aligns with its structural properties—--providing it with an entity yields a truth value relative to a model, representing the extensional meaning of a sentence.

```
F('danced') = lambda x: danced_f(x)
F('Trump') = "t"
F('Trump danced') = F('danced')(F('Trump'))
``` 

However, a transitive verb cannot be defined in the same way, as it requires two arguments to form a sentence. Given a sentence *S* with a transitive verb $TV$, since the extensional meaning of *S* is its truth value in a model, we can infer that the meaning of $TV$ is a function that maps two entities to a truth value.  

            S                              
           / \
         NP   VP              
         |    / \
      Trump  V   NP
             |    |
          dislikes Biden

```
F('Trump dislikes Biden') = F('dislikes Binden')(F('Trump'))
                          = [F('dislikes')(F('Biden'))](F('Trump'))
```
  
- The type of the sentence meaning is $t$.
- The type of F('Trump') is $e$.
- The type of F('Biden') is $e$.

If F('Trump dislikes Biden') = F('dislikes Binden')(F('Trump')) and F('dislikes Binden')(F('Trump')) is of type $t$, then 

- F('dislikes')(F('Biden')) must be of type $e \rightarrow t$

If F('dislikes')(F('Biden')) is of type $e \rightarrow t$ and F('Biden') is of type $e$, then 

- F('dislikes') must be type of $e \rightarrow e \rightarrow t$

Then, how should F('dislikes') be defined?

## Relations

The extensional meaning of a transitive verb can be understood as a set of pairs. Consider the following real-life scenario from G7 summit in 2018: 

![Alt Text](https://github.com/haozeli-ling/Semantic-Analysis/blob/main/model.png)

Let's focus on five political leaders---Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump---and one document---Doc $\alpha$. 

- In mathematics, a relation denotes some kind of relationship between two objects in a set. Formally, a relation $R$ over a set $X$ can be seen as a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of members of $X$. The table below illustrates all possible pairs formed from the set containing the six entities mentioned earlier. 

|          | Trump    | May      | Trudeau  | Macron   | Doc-Alpha | Merkel   |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Trump** | (Trump, Trump)        | (Trump, May) | (Trump, Trudeau) | (Trump, Macron) | (Trump, Doc-Alpha) | (Trump, Merkel) |
| **May**   | (May, Trump) | (May, May)       | (May, Trudeau)   | (May, Macron)   | (May, Doc-Alpha)   | (May, Merkel)   |
| **Trudeau** | (Trudeau, Trump) | (Trudeau, May) | (Trudeau, Trudeau)         | (Trudeau, Macron) | (Trudeau, Doc-Alpha) | (Trudeau, Merkel) |
| **Macron** | (Macron, Trump) | (Macron, May) | (Macron, Trudeau) | (Macron, Macron)        | (Macron, Doc-Alpha) | (Macron, Merkel) |
| **Doc-Alpha** | (Doc-Alpha, Trump) | (Doc-Alpha, May) | (Doc-Alpha, Trudeau) | (Doc-Alpha, Macron) | (Doc-Alpha, Doc-Alpha)        | (Doc-Alpha, Merkel) |
| **Merkel** | (Merkel, Trump) | (Merkel, May) | (Merkel, Trudeau) | (Merkel, Macron) | (Merkel, Doc-Alpha) | (Merkel, Merkel)       |
  
- Given the scenario from G7, a 'looking-at' relation can be modeled as such a set:  

  - $A'$ = { ($\text{trump}$, $\text{merkel}$), ($\text{merkel}$, $\text{trump}$), ($\text{trudeau}$, $\text{trump}$), ($\text{macron}$, $\text{doc}$- $\alpha$), ($\text{may}$, $\text{doc}$- $\alpha$) }
  - The set $A'$ can be re-written as: { $(x,y) : x\ \text{looked at}\ y$ }

This set can be transformed into a characteristic function that map pairs to truth values. 

```
F('looked at') = lambda (x,y) in A X A: 1 iff (x,y) in {(x,y) : x looked at y} <= A X A
Type: (e X e) -> t 
```

However, this function does not align with the structural properties of English. Consider the structure of the sentence "Trump looked at Merkel," where the verb combines with the object first. The object, however, denotes an entity rather than a pair.

               S
              / \
            NP   VP
            |    / \
         Trump  V   NP
                |    |
          looked-at  Merkel

Lambda Calculus provides a solution for this problem.

> Using the $\lambda$ operator to bind $x$ return another function:

> As a result, ...

> F('looked at') = lambda y lambda x: 1 iff (x,y) in {(x,y): x looked at y} <= A X A
>                = lmabda y lambda x: looked_at_f(x,y)
> Type: e -> e -> t
> ```

Then, the extensional meaning of 'Trump looked at Merkel', i.e., $⟦\text{Trump looked at Merkel}⟧^M$, can be computed as follows:

```
F('Trump looked at Merkel') = F('looked at')(F('Merkel'))(F('Trump'))
                            = [lambda y lambda x : looked_at_f (x,y)]("m")("t")
                            = [lambda x : looked_at_f (x, "m")]("t")
                            = looked_at_f("t", "m")
                            = 1 iff ("t", "m") in {(x, y) : x looked at y} <= A X A
```

Based on this computation, the extensional meaning of the verb phrase 'looked at Merkel' is:  

```
F('looked at Merkel') = lambda x : looked_at_f (x, "m")
```
