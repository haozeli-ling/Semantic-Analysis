# Generalized Quantifiers: Composition 

In the last session, we saw that quantifiers differ dramatically in their ‘logical behavior’ from other nominal expressions of type $e$, such as proper names, definite descriptions, and pronouns. These differences motivated a semantics where quantifiers are type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$, and quantificational determiners, such as 'some', 'every', or 'most', are of type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow (e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$. The meaning of a quanficational sentence is expressing the relation of two sets of individuals. 

- $⟦\text{every man smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ = { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\subseteq$ { $x \mid \text{smokes}'(x) = 1$ }
- $⟦\text{most men smoke}⟧^{M,g}$ = | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x)= 1$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smoke}'(x) =1$ } | / | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } | = 0.5
- $⟦\text{some men smoke}⟧^{M,g}$ = { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smoke}'(x) = 1$ } $\neq$ $\emptyset$
- $⟦\text{no man smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ = { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smokes}'(x) = 1$ } = $\emptyset$
- $⟦\text{(at least) three men smoke}⟧^{M,g}$ = | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smoke}'(x) = 1$ } | $\geq$ 3
- $⟦\text{at most three men smoke}⟧^{M,g}$ = | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smoke}'(x)= =1$ } | $\leq$ 3
- $⟦\text{exactly three men smoke}⟧^{M,g}$ = | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smoke}'(x) = 1$ } | = 3

### Composition 

$⟦\text{every}⟧^{M,g}$ = $\lambda P \lambda P'$. { $x \mid P(x) = 1$ } $\subseteq$ { $x \mid P'(x) = 1$ }

$⟦\text{every man smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ <br>
= $⟦\text{every}⟧^{M,g}$ ($⟦\text{man}⟧^{M,g}$) ($⟦\text{smokes}⟧^{M,g}$) <br>
= [ $\lambda P'$. { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\subseteq$ { $x \mid P'(x) = 1$ } ] ($⟦\text{smokes}⟧^{M,g}$) <br>
= { $x \mid \text{man}'(x) = 1$ } $\subseteq$ { $x \mid \text{smokes}'(x) = 1$ } 

Unfortunately, our semantics encounters significant problems with any sentence in which a quantifier appears in a position other than the subject!

1. Donald imposed tariffs on every country. 

```                 
                 e         ??
                 |      /     \
             Donald    /       \
                      /         \
                     /           \
                  e -> e -> t  (e -> t) -> t
                    |            /  \
               'tariffed'        D    NP
                                 |    |
                               every country

```

- The transitive verb cannot combine with the object quantifier because of the type mismatch.

### Towards the Theory of Quantifier Raising 

To work toward a solution to the problem, let’s start by considering the truth conditions our system should derive for this sentence.

2. The sentence 'Donald imposed tariffs on every country' is true iff for the set of countries is the subset of the set of entities that Donald imposed tariffs on.

We could derive the truth condition in 2 for sentence 1 if we could somehow seperate the quantifier from the rest of the sentence. 

> every (country) (Donald imposed tariffs on) 
> 'country' provides a set of countries
> 'Donald imposed tariffs on' provides a set of the entities that Donald imposed tariffs on.

To achieve this, we assume that the quantifier 'every country' undergo raising in semantic computation. 

3. [every country] [Donald imposed tariffs on $t_1$ ]

When you encounter a trace, which semantic operation would you think should be used to interpret it?

Exercise: Please compute the extensional meanings for the following sentences.

1. Peter ate nothing.
2. Mary read most books.
