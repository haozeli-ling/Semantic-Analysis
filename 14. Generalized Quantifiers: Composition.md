# Generalized Quantifiers: Composition 

In the last session, we saw that quantifiers differ dramatically in their ‘logical behavior’ from other nominal expressions of type $e$, such as proper names, definite descriptions, and pronouns. These differences motivated a semantics where quantifiers are type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$, and quantificational determiners, such as 'some', 'every', or 'most', are of type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow (e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$. The meaning of a quanficational sentence is expressing the relation of two sets of individuals. 

- $⟦\text{every man smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ = { $x \mid \text{man}'(x)$ } $\subseteq$ { $x \mid \text{smokes}'(x)$ }
- $⟦\text{most men smokes}⟧^{M,g}$ = | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x)$ } $\cap$ { $x \mid \text{smokes}'(x)$ } | / | { $x \mid \text{man}'(x)$ } | = 0.5
