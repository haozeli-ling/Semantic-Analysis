# Generalized Quantifiers: Composition 

In the last session, we saw that quantifiers differ dramatically in their ‘logical behavior’ from other nominal expressions of type $e$, such as proper names, definite descriptions, and pronouns. These differences motivated a semantics where quantifiers are type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow t$, and quantificational determiners, such as 'some', 'every', or 'most', are of type . The meaning of a quanficational sentence is expressing the relation of two sets of individuals.
