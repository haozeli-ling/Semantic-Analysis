# Semantic Analysis

Welcome to the website for *Semantics Analysis*. This course builds on the foundational concepts introduced in *Semantics & Pragmatics*, with a specialized focus on compositional semanticsâ€”the study of how complex meanings are systematically constructed from the meanings of smaller components and the rules governing their combination. 

Throughout the course, we will investigate how compositionality interacts with syntax to generate meaning, analyze linguistic phenomena through formal semantic frameworks, and scrutinize the theoretical foundations of compositional semantics. By the end of this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of compositional semantics and its central role in explaining the structure and interpretation of natural language.  

Below is an up-to-date overview of our schedule, with links to notes from class where applicable.
