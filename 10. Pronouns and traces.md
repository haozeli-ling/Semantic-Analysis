# Pronouns and binding

Consider the following sentences, whose meanings are undetermined. 

1. **He** was old.
2. Terrance **did**, too.
3. If **so**, I'll be very happy.
4. **Such** people made me mad.

To determine semantic value of an anaphoric expression such as he, so, such, or anaphoric ∅ (as in (1b)), we need to know what its antecedent is, and we need to know the semantic rules that determine the value of the anaphor in terms of the value of its antecedent. In a simple case like John and he in (1a), the antecedent refers to an individual, and the pronoun refers to the same individual. The examples in (1b-d) show that anaphora is not always a relation between individual-denoting expressions, and example (1e) shows that even with pronominal anaphora, the anaphoric relation is not always a relation of “coreference”, as it seems to be in (1a).
