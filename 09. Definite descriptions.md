# Definite descriptions

So far, our algorithm can handle the meaning of common nouns in predicate positions. However, the most typical position for common nouns is within phrases that serve as arguments. 

1. [A politician] arrived in DC.
2. People dislike [the politician].
3. [Many politicians] are liars.
4. [Politicians] are dishonest.

In this session, we will focus on the meanings of definite descriptions.

### Type of definite descriptions

Let's determine the type of definite descriptions based on the inference of lambda deduction. 

5. The president imposed tariffs on Canada.

- For simplicity, we assume that "imposed tariffs on" is one single item denoting a function of type $e \rightarrow e \rightarrow t$, i.e., a transitive verb.
- It takes "Canada" as the object and "the president" as the subject to generate the extensional denotation of the whole sentence, which is of type $t$. 
- "Canada" denotes the country of type $e$.
- Therefore, "the president" must be of type $e$, even though we have not explicitly defined its lexical semantics.  

Given our previous discussion, the meaning of a common noun is a function of type $e \rightarrow t$.
