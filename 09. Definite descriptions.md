# Definite descriptions

So far, our algorithm can handle the meaning of common nouns in predicate positions. However, the most typical position for common nouns is within phrases that serve as arguments. 

1. [A politician] arrived in DC.
2. People dislike [the politician].
3. [Many politicians] are liars.
4. [Politicians] are dishonest.

In this session, we will focus on the meanings of definite descriptions.

### Types of definite descriptions and the definite article

Let's determine the type of definite descriptions based on the inference of lambda deduction. 

5. The president imposed tariffs on Canada.

- For simplicity, we assume that "imposed tariffs on" is one single item denoting a function of type $e \rightarrow e \rightarrow t$, i.e., a transitive verb.
- It takes "Canada" as the object and "the president" as the subject to generate the extensional denotation of the whole sentence, which is of type $t$. 
- "Canada" denotes the country of type $e$.
- Therefore, "the president" must be of type $e$, even though we have not explicitly defined its lexical semantics.  

Given our previous discussion, the meaning of a common noun is a function of type $e \rightarrow t$. If "the president" is of type $e$, then the definite article "the" must be a function of type $(e \rightarrow t) \rightarrow e$.  

- $⟦\text{the president}⟧^M$ = $⟦\text{the}⟧^M (⟦\text{president}⟧^M)$ = $⟦\text{the}⟧^M (\lambda x. \text{president}'(x))$ = $⟦\text{Donald Trump}⟧^M$ = $\text{t}$

The function denoted by "the" maps the meaning of a common noun to a specific individual. How?

### Uniqueness condition

The key feature of definite descriptions is that their referent must be a unique individual in the given model.  

Let's re-consider the real-life scenario from G7 summit in 2018:

If someone uttered "The president was discussing an important issue", how would you respond? --- Probably, you would say "which one?" This is because the scenaro includes more than one president, making it unclear which one the definite description refers to. 

By contrast, the sentence "The president was greeting us" is felicitous in the following scenario, where only one individual has the "president" property.

Generally, a definite description [the NP] is felicitous only when the domain of the extension of "NP" includes only one entity that is mapped to True. 

- $⟦\text{president}⟧^M = \lambda x. \text{present}'(x)$ = [ $\text{t} \rightarrow 1$, $\text{m} \rightarrow 0$, $\text{v} \rightarrow 0$, $\text{u} \rightarrow 0$ ]
